Use emojis for better visual recognition:

- 🤔 **Thinking** — questions, considerations, suggestions to explore, decision points

- ❌ **Error** — failures, rejected options, blockers

## Development General Guidelines

- Avoid nested if statements.

- Refer to available skills when possible.
- Use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
